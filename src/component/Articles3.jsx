    <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">Two weeks to go for your beach vacation, but there's a problem: your skin is not at all prepared for the onslaught of sun, sea, and sand. No worries. Follow our tips and you'll arrive on the beach ready to get your glow on.</p>

     <h1 className="md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white mt-14"><span className='text-primary'>1. Scrub Your Skin</span></h1>
      <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">To get an even tan, your skin needs to be clean. A few days before you head out on your vacation, apply a full body scrub. Face, neck, arms, back, tummy, buttocks, legs, every little inch. Choose a scrub with a grain suited to the area you're treating, and scrub when you're in the shower, as the steam will open your pores. Try the L’Oréal Paris Pure-Clay Exfoliate & Smooth scrub</p>


    {/* Type2 */}

    
    <h1 className="md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white mt-14"><span className='text-primary'>2. Hydration Is Key</span></h1>
      <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">It's essential to hydrate and nourish your holiday skin before, during and after you've been in the sun. Two weeks before you leave, start to gorge your skin with water and lipids. Use moisturisers that hydrate and nourish your skin. The new L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Crystal Micro-Essence is a water-based formula that penetrates up to 10 skin layers to reveal bright, radiant, crystal clear skin.</p>

      <h1 className="md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white mt-14"><span className='text-primary'>3. Fake Tan For The Sun-Kissed Glow</span></h1>
      <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">This is a must if you don't want to rock up with lily-bright skin. A few days before you pack your bags, apply a self-tanning cream or gel. Make sure you carefully work it in, to avoid any nasty streaks. You'll turn up with enviable bronzed limbs from the off.
