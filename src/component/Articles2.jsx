But do you know how hyaluronic acid works? Some of us know of it but are not fully aware of the myths and facts about hyaluronic acid. As hyaluronic acid has become increasingly popular, misinformation has flooded the internet. So today, we’ll be busting myths and shedding some light on hyaluronic acid facts. Read ahead to know more.</p>

            <h1 className="md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white mt-14">Hyaluronic <span className='text-primary'>Acid Myths</span></h1>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">1. Hyaluronic acid fillers are the only way to get smooth skin

                There is no doubt that hyaluronic acid fillers are a great way to quickly improve the hyaluronic acid levels in the skin, but you don’t need to poke yourself with needles to reap its benefits. Consuming hyaluronic acid capsules orally or using topical skincare products that contain the acid are other effective ways to increase your body’s supply of hyaluronic acid.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">2. Hyaluronic acid levels remain constant in your body

                The levels of hyaluronic acid in the body decrease as you age. This partly explains the dehydration and wrinkles that come with age. By the time you turn 50, hyaluronic acid levels in the body will have decreased by about 50 per cent. This causes the appearance of fine lines and the skin becomes less firm.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">3. Hyaluronic acid is an exfoliant

                Since hyaluronic comes in the category of acid, most people tend to put it in the same category as other chemical exfoliants such as salicylic acid or glycolic acid. But unlike them, hyaluronic acid face cream, serum or other products containing the acid do not exfoliate the skin. Instead, skincare products containing hyaluronic acid help your skin retain moisture, improve its hydration and act as humectants.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">4. One of the hyaluronic acid side effects is inflammation

                Hyaluronic acid works well only in areas where required and doesn’t leave your skin irritated. For example, if you face a cut on the skin, hyaluronic acid triggers an anti-inflammatory reaction and helps to repair the wound. This magic ingredient saves your skin from prolonged inflammation. However, if you’re still unsure of the hyaluronic acid side effects on the skin, we recommend doing a patch test before applying the product all over.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">5. Hyaluronic acid only helps with dry skin

                Hyaluronic acid is ideal for all skin types, including oily and acne-prone skin. People often think that these skin types don’t need hydration, but this is a misconception. Regardless of your skin type, you need to hydrate your skin to maintain its moisture levels and products containing hyaluronic acid are superb for hydration as they help your skin retain and absorb water and achieve smooth, supple, and plump skin over time.</p>

            <h1 className="md:text-2xl lg:text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white mt-14">Hyaluronic<span className='text-primary'> acid facts</span></h1>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">1. Hyaluronic acid is a natural substance

                Hyaluronic acid is present throughout the body. It is found in humans and animals, concentrated in the joints, the eyes and the skin's dermis. Biodegradable, biocompatible and biomimetic, it is formulated via a biotechnological process using energy and bacteria. Its main function is to keep the joints and tissues of your body well lubricated. Apart from retaining moisture, it also helps to make your skin appear more youthful.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">2. Hyaluronic acid acts at various levels

                The hyaluronic acid molecule acts like a sponge in the dermis, capturing water and multiplying its volume a thousand-fold. This is why hyaluronic acid skincare products are famous for their plumping and moisturising action. Depending on the molecule's size, it can penetrate the skin's various layers to regenerate and restructure them. The smaller the size of the molecule, the deeper it penetrates the skin's tissues. In the dermis, these smaller fragments of the acid then stimulate the body to produce its version, alongside collagen fibres.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">3. Hyaluronic acid works well for ageing skin

                The main benefit of hyaluronic acid for the skin is hydration. Apart from this, hyaluronic acid is also widely used as an anti-ageing ingredient for people with mature skin. Products containing hyaluronic acid help to boost your skin’s collagen production which in turn can decrease the depth of your wrinkles and make them less visible with regular use. Some hyaluronic acid skincare products also improve your skin’s elasticity and make it appear firm and tight over time.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">4. Hyaluronic acid binds water

                Hyaluronic acid is a humectant and loves water. A humectant is a substance that reduces the loss of moisture and helps to preserve it. The fact is that hyaluronic acid can hold up to 1000x of its weight in water. Only one per cent of the acid can bind 99% of water, that’s how much moisture it can bring to your skin. There is no other natural substance of the body that can retain and preserve this much water.</p>
            <p className=" md:text-base lg:text-base leading-relaxed text-white text-justify mt-14">5. Hyaluronic acid isn’t an acid

                The truth is that hyaluronic acid isn’t actually an acid. It is a type of sugar called Glycosaminoglycan.

                So, keep these things in mind and browse through a wide range of L'Oréal Paris’ products containing Hyaluronic Acid for skin to achieve maximum benefits and flaunt the skin of your dreams with ease!</p>
